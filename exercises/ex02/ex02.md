# Exercise 2
## Pointers


### The address space

1. Compile and run `aspace.c` in this directory.

2. Read the code.  You might want to [read about malloc here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_malloc.htm).

3. Based on the output, draw a sketch of the virtual address space (see page 80 of HFC).  Show the relative locations of the stack, heap, globals, constants, and code.

4. Add a second call to `malloc` and check whether the heap on your system grows up (toward larger addresses). 

Yes, the address of the newly allocated variable, which occurs right after `*p`, is higher than that of `*p` 

5. Add a function that prints the address of a local variable, and check whether the stack grows down. 

It does. 

6. Choose a random number between 1 and 32, and allocate two chunks with that size.  
How much space is there between them?  Hint: Google knows how to subtract hexadecimal numbers.

32 bytes.


### Stack allocated data

1.  Read `stack.c`, which should be in this directory.  What is it
intended to do?  What would the output be if the program worked as
expected?

It looks like it's intending to assign all of the values of an array to 42 and print those. The output should be: 
42
42
42
42
42

2.  Compile it.  Do you get a warning?  What does it mean?

I got the warning: address of stack memory associated with local variable 'array' returned [-Wreturn-stack-address]

Essentially, what's happening is that memory is being allocated on the stack during the function call. This memory is freed once the function call completes, yet there is a pointer being returned from that function. This pointer refers to unallocated memory.  

3.  Run it.  What happens?  You might get a segmentation fault, or you might get 
some strange output.  Can you explain it?  You might find it
helpful to draw a stack diagram.

It's printing a bunch of zeroes, which I think comes from the unallocated memory on the stack. The second array value is a random integer, which I think is a pointer (and may be the first pointer to the array)

4.  Comment out the `print` statements in `foo()` and `bar()` and run 
it again.  What happens now?

The same thing.

Moral: Don't return pointers to stack allocated data!

### Write some code

Create a file named `adder.c` and write a program that allows the user to enter integers, one per line, until the user hits Control-D, which is the end-of-file (EOF) character.

It should convert the numbers from input strings to integers and store the integers in an array.  The program should produce appropriate error messages if the user enters something that exceeds the length of the input buffer, or can't be converted to an integer.  It should also produce an error message if the user enters more numbers than will fit in the array.

After the user enters Control-D, the program should add up the numbers in the array and print the result.  

Your program should be divided into at least two functions with well designed interfaces.

Optionally, the program should produce an error if the sum exceeds the largest integer that can be represented.

Hint: You will probably want to use two functions we haven't seen yet:

* strlen: [Read about it here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_strlen.htm)

* atoi: [Read about it here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_atoi.htm)

Before you use there functions, you need to `#include <string.h>`.
